# generator-esnext-test

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

> A Yeoman generator for creating tests using what's next in JavaScript.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-esnext-test using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-esnext-test
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo esnext-test
```

## What You Get

The following is installed by this generator (`helper.js` is only installed when the `helper` option/ prompt is true, which it is by default):

```
|-- package.json
|-- test/
  |-- helper.js
```

The `package.json` file is created if it does not exist, and the `scripts` property is augmented with a `test` and `test:watch` command (and a `test:cover` command, if the `coverage` option/ prompt is set to `true`).

You can change the test directory by setting the `testDir` option/ prompt.

## Getting To Know Yeoman
